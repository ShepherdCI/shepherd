    "message": "Rename integrations to services\n\nThe domain model term \"integration\" was originally chosen before it was\nclear that the primary (or at least initial) feature set of Shepherd was\nto be Continuous Integration. This overlap in terms makes things\nunclear, so renaming to service disambiguates the two.\n\nThis also removes all of the models, delayed jobs, and CSS for the\noriginal hound linters, as this is not an immediate priority and\nwouldn't be worth the effort to rename it all.  If and when the linting\nis integrated into the codebase, Hound will have significantly changed\ntheir code for those things.",
